# Minimal Viewmodels Reborn

This is a remake of the original Minimal Viewmodels mod, updated with many new features and bugfixes. 
(thanks to [malco](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/malco/) for creating the original!)

## Features

Features that were in the original:

- Customisable viewmodel FOV and offset
- The ability to completely hide your viewmodel

Extra features in this version:

- The mod now works on low and medium graphics settings
- Several bugfixes, including placing holograms being offset and bullet tracers not coming from the right place
- The ability to customise the intensity and size of muzzle flashes (Ever tried using the qcw or ak in a dark area?)
- The ability to hide your arms
- The ability to customise the fov increase when sprinting and sliding
- The mod's options now update properly at runtime when modified, meaning you can use mods such as[BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager)
to adjust options and see them update ingame immediately (which I highly recommend trying!)

## Usage

All customisation options are available in the mod's config file. For more details on each option check its
description~ as always, you can find me on the straftat discord @sneaky_kestrel if you need any more help.

## Manual Installation Instructions

_**(you should probably just use a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) though)**_

- Download and install [Bepinex 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) <br><small>(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0 and it might work. maybe)</small>
- Once BepInEx is installed, extract the zip into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
